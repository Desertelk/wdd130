    <h1>My Favorite City</h1>
    <p>My favorite city is Las Vegas because it is where I was born and raised.</p>
    <p>Many people think that the only thing that someone can do in Vegas is going to the part of town known as "The
        Strip" but you can ask most locals and they will tell you that there are several other things than go downtown
